# Sales analysis
This repo will showcase me using python to carry out sales analysis.

Firstly, i will be reading all the files in the dataset folder so that I can combine the dataframes of all the files
to create 1 large dataframe that can be explored. This will be achieved by using the OS library.

Secondly, I will then be cleaing the data: formating the columns to ensure that they are using the correct data type
,creating new columns that will be needed to explore the dataframe and then also ensuring all null values and irrelevant 
data is removed from the dataframe. This will be achieved by using the 
pandas library.

Finally, I will aggregate the data in order to summerise it. I will then visualise those aggregations by using a 
line and bar graph. This will be achieved by using the matplotlib library.
